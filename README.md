# Automated-Onboarding-Azure-Project

Project Intro
I have been working on some hands on projects in Azure to further build and expand my cloud skills. This project is one of the project ideas inspired by Gwyneth Pe√±a-Siguenza. Big shout out to her for all the incredible content she puts out. I highly recommend her youtube channel for anyone who is looking to advance their career.

The aim of the project is to streamline and automate the process of onboarding a new employee into Azure AD now known as Entra ID, and assigning the user necessary Azure resources. Utilizing Azure Logic Apps, the process is to have the new team member details input into Logic Apps which then creates the user account, adds them to a group and assigns them neccessary roles and permissions. Thereafter, finally sends a welcome email to the manager advising of account creation. I used the HTTP request option, making use of the Thunder Client VSCode extension to trigger the Logic App workflow.
